## Welcome to the COLRC Tutorial Center

This is where you come to learn about how the COLRC team uses git, vscode, docker, and other tools. You can also learn about how the to mdodify and add to the code base, and how to use the existing site as it is deployed in both production and development.

# Using git

2. Configure username and email

```
## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/arizona-linguistics/colrc-v2/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/arizona-linguistics/colrc-v2/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
