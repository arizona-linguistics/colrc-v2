1. Update your title page, including your honor footnote.  Make sure it's all accurate and complete for Step 5.
2. Update your change log to contain only the changes you've made between steps 4 and 5.
3. Proofread everything.
4. Double (or triple) check all in-text citations and your reference page.  Make sure they're correct and complete and match our styleguide.
5. Double (or triple) check all IPA transcriptions of your words and sentences.  Make sure that a reader can correctly pronounce your examples based on the IPA transcription.
6. Double (or triple) check all multi-line glosses.  Line 1 is well-formed IPA.  Line 2 is morpheme by morpheme glosses.  Line 3 is how you would say that in English.  There is always the same number of hyphens at line 1 as there is at line 2.
7. Make sure that the paper looks as beautiful as possible.  Title page is accurate and clean.  Margins, typeface, indentation, and section heading styles are consistent throughout.  All examples are consecutively numbered. 
8. Prepare yourself for praise and adulation.  Your Final Paper (Step 5) will be amazing, and you will be so proud of it!
