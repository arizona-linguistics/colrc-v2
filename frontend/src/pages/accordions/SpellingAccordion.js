			  	<span>Coeur d'Alene has been spelled using at least three different systems - the "Reichard Orthography" (see Reichard 1938), the "Nicodemus Orthography" (see Nicodemus 1975a,b) and the "Salishan Orthography". What we refer to as the Reichard Orthography is a variation of the transcription system used by many linguists and anthropologists trained by Franz Boas at Columbia University in the first half of the 20th century. The Nicodemus Orthography was developed for use by the Coeur d'Alene community. The Salishan Orthography is used by many linguists and anthropologists today to transcribe Coeur d'Alene. You will find it used in contemporary scholarly work about the language. This site is intended to support users who want to use any of these systems.</span>
			    <span>The list below shows how the symbols used in each of these three systems correspond to each other. Not all of the sounds used in the Coeur d'Alene language are familiar to English speakers, but many of them are. Sounds in Coeur d'Alene that are also found in English words are listed with examples from English so that learners can familiarize themselves with those sounds.</span>

			  	<span>Coeur d'Alene uses some sounds that will be unfamiliar to English speakers. In this resource, we provide information about how the sounds are pronounced, using the terminology that linguists have developed to describe these processes.  For those who don't (yet) have training in "articulatory phonetics", we recommend working with a teacher who can help you learn to pronounce the sounds.</span>
				<span>Linguists use the term "phoneme" to refer to a sound that is used to distinguish words in a particular language. The charts below, adapted from Doak 1997 and Barthmaier 1996, show the consonant and vowel phonemes of Coeur d'Alene, based on the ways in which each is pronounced. We have used the Salishan Orthography to represent these sounds, as we anticipate this resource to be of most use to scholars in linguistics. Students interested in learning how to pronounce Coeur d'Alene might also find these charts useful if they have some background in the study of "articulatory phonetics".</span>
