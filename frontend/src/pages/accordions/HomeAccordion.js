			  	<span><p>The <a href="http://lasrv01.pfw.edu/crd_archive/start1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original Coeur d'Alene Archive</a> was created by Shannon Bischoff and Musa Yassin Fort in the summer of 2009. The original website was created without any prior web design/building knowledge using <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">w3schools.com</a> free tutorials over a period of six weeks.  The site was constructed using simple html, javascript, and css code, all designed based on lessons at the site. The search mechanisms were a bit more complicated and required php, which can also be learned at the w3 schools website.</p></span>
  		      	<span><p>A <a href="http://lasrv01.pfw.edu/COLRC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second version of the website</a> is was developed in 2013 with the support of the National Science Foundation (award numbers BCS-1160394 and BCS-1160627), using these freely available, open-source, and easily learnable tools - expanded to include xml and ajax. You can find free tutorials for all of these tools at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">w3schools.com</a>. That site includes our <a href="http://lasrv01.pfw.edu/COLRC/home/mission.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mission Statement</a> and <a href="http://lasrv01.pfw.edu/COLRC/home/history.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">History of Materials</a>.</p></span>
            	<span><p>The current site's development began in 2019 with the support of the National Endowment for the Humanities award number PD-261031-18, using more specialized open-source tools that allow increased functionality and responsive design.  The site is developed and maintained using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a>, <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL</a>, <a href="https://hasura.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hasura</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">postgresSQL</a> (community edition).  All of these tools are open source and available at no cost.  You can find many excellent free tutorials on these tools at each resource homepage, and by searching online.</p></span>

			  <span>Additional resources will be included, as well as further documentation about the methods used by Reichard and Nicodemus to collect many of these resources. We also will be posting our source files (for all material other than the language resources themselves) to the site, so that anyone who would like to make use of our code to develop their own websites may do so. If you would like to help or have questions, comments or suggestions, please contact the team.</span>
